[00:00.10] Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
[00:06.65] And how much can I be expected to tolerate?
[00:12.67] So I started to think about the plans I made
[00:15.84] The debt unpaid
[00:19.50] And you just can't call
[00:22.00] A spade a spade
[00:29.50] 
[00:26.26] I watch the moon
[00:31.00] Let it run my mood
[00:34.27] Can't stop thinking of you
[00:39.26] I watch you (And I watch as things play out like)
[00:45.72] So long nice to know you I'll be
[00:49.02] Moving on
[00:52.40] We started off in such a nice place
[00:55.60] We were talking the same language
[00:58.90] I open and I'm closing
[01:02.25] You can't stand the thought
[01:04.20] Of a real beating heart
[01:06.02] You'd be holding, having trouble
[01:09.38] Oh-oh
[01:10.26] Owning and admit that
[01:12.99] I am hoping
[01:15.21] I watch the moon
[01:19.87] Let it run my mood
[01:23.27] Can't stop thinking of you
[01:28.20] I watch you (And I watch as things play out like)
[01:34.68] So long nice to know you I'll be
[01:37.94] Moving on
[01:41.47] Moving on
[01:45.97] 
[02:10.75] You
[02:11.89] Yeah, I always know the truth
[02:15.11] But I can't just say it to you
[02:18.87] Yeah, I know the truth
[02:23.27] I knew
[02:24.80] Yeah, I always know the truth
[02:28.19] But I can't just say it to you
[02:31.85] Yeah, I know the truth
[02:37.26] I never thought we'd see it through
[02:39.84] I never could rely on you
[02:44.12] And few times your face came
[02:49.20] Into view
[02:52.65] Into view
[02:55.73] Into view
[02:58.78] Into you
